"""
The first loop is to exclude n - 1 labels that are not possible to be a celebrity.
After the first loop, x is the only candidate.
The second and third loop is to verify x is actually a celebrity by definition.

The key part is the first loop. To understand this you can think the knows(a,b)
as a a < b comparison, if a knows b then a < b, if a does not know b, a > b.
Then if there is a celebrity, he/she must be the "maximum" of the n people.

However, the "maximum" may not be the celebrity in the case of no celebrity at all.
Thus we need the second and third loop to check if x is actually celebrity by definition.
