#2: Dynamic Programming
"""
For each (cardinal) direction, and for each coordinate (r, c)
let's compute the count of that coordinate: the longest line of '1's starting from (r, c)
and going in that direction. With dynamic programming, it is either 0 if grid[r][c] is zero,
else it is 1 plus the count of the coordinate in the same direction. For example,
if the direction is left and we have a row like 01110110,
the corresponding count values are 01230120, and the integers are either 1 more than their successor,
or 0. For each square, we want dp[r][c] to end up being the minimum of the 4 possible counts.
At the end, we take the maximum value in dp.
